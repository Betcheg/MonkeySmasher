### Demo

https://betcheg.github.io/index.html

Player 1 (Monkey) : Press arrow keys to move.

Player 2 (Blocks) : Press A, Z, E to make the blocks fall.

### This is a two player game created with love and HTML5 

* Player one must take the key and bring it back to the monkey house with the right and left key on the pad
* Player two tries to crush the monkey with the 3 blocks available on the map
* This is a mind game. Try to outplay your opponent!

Also this game is heavily documented, may be useful for folks interested in HTML5!

### Futur fixes
- Multiplayer available
- Time out
- BETTER DESIGN
